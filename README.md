# COVID 19 Data Analytics Dashboard

The goal of the project was to provide an interactive, simple yet informative visualization of COVID-19 worldwide data for analytical purposes. We tried to visualize how the demographic information of the world and COVID 19 are correlated to one another. The main objective of this project is to visualize the COVID-19 data by standard and non-standard graphs and to see what kind of factors affect the intensity of the virus (reach). This goal was achieved with the following objectives:
1. Choropleth map of the world to depict the current state of the world.
2. Multiline line plot that depicts the trend of cases, deaths, and recoveries.
3. Barplot that allowed comparative visualization of total cases in all countries.
4. Scatterplot for finding the correlation between two attributes of the data.
5. Parallel coordinate plot for providing high dimensional visualization.

The aim of the project is to help users with no background in medicine understand the impact of the virus and track various developments that happen through the course of time. This will allow the user to understand different aspects of the virus and the impact it has on different groups of people separated by age, population, economic condition, demography, etc as well as track the increase or decrease in the number of cases, deaths, recoveries over the course of time.
